== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q: What music formats does it support? =

A:  Format	MIME-type
	MP3	audio/mpeg
	Ogg	audio/ogg
	Wav	audio/wav

= Q: Why can not I upload a song file to my site? =

A: This is due to two reasons:
1. The ability to upload a file to your service is a big threat.
2. Because of the optimization of your resource. Any video and audio create a high load on your resource.

If you want to still use the file from your server, you can upload it via ftp. After that, insert the direct path to your file in the plugin's settings.
